  "menu.minez_help.description.gettingstarted": "§lThe Basics:\n§f• MineZ is a zombie apocalypse game, so horde of zombies and some zombie-ish mobs such as zombie pigmen and wolves await! There may be other more terrifying creatures out there.\n\n• The experience level is your thirst level. 25 is the maximum amount of hydration you can have, but don't let it get to 0 otherwise you will start to dehydrate and die! You can only replenish it by drinking from your water bottle or by eating. For long journeys, it may be wiser to carry more than one water bottle and refill it in every town with water. We recommend drink a water bottle when your thirst level is between 2-0.\n\n• The experience bar is the zombies' visibility level on you. The higher your visibility, the further and easier can a zombie spot you! You can sneak to keep your visibility to a minimum, but sprinting (even in water) and jumping will greatly increase your visibility and make you an easier target for zombies!\n\n• In MineZ the zombies are faster, stronger and smarter than the ones you can find in Vanilla Minecraft. They are as fast as a sprinting person, but if they lose sight of you they find go back to your previous location to trap you.\n\n• Chatting System is also modified. It is divided into Local and Global. Local shows player messages at a distance of 250m and less from you. Global displays all messages when the player uses ! At the beginning of their message.\n\n• Spawn into the world by Talking to the NPC next to the fountain. When you first spawn, you will spawn with a water bottle, a wooden sword, and a bandage.\n\n• You can buy other things with XP on the XP Shop to add to your Spawn Kit as well as getting them from achievements.\n\n• Playing on MineZ you have two types of servers to choose from PVP and PVE. PVE servers are only for players who buy a rank on the server's website. PVP servers, also called Public, also have a small part of the map with PVE, this is an area up to Z= -100, then there is a PVP zone.\n\n§lTypes of Players:\n §cBandits:\n§f  • Bandits are players that will kill anyone else on sight. They are categorized into several types: Leather Bandits,\n    Iron Roamers, Tricksters and Massacre Teams.\n    Leather Bandits are newly spawned bandits that hit anyone in sight despite having poor gear.\n    Iron Roamers are iron-clad bandits that wander around the map, killing usually to obtain health potions.\n    Tricksters are bandits who pretend to befriend you before killing you.\n    Massacre Teams are small groups of well-armed bandits that loot town by town.\n    They can easil noy be spotted with sprinting players, clans of iron bandits and large slews of death messages appearing on the chat as they battle other groups of players.\n §aHealers:\n§f  • Healers are players that do not attack people on sight, but rather heal them and supply them with food, armor, gear etc. to send them on their way. However, do not let this facade of a friendly player fool you -occasionally, healers may be luring people with low health to them so they may kill them, as well as the fact that if you plan on becoming a healer, people may see you as a lesser-defended target and hunt you down. Healers that have healed 16 different people will have the Healer tag as a sign to others that they are reliable healers to trust.",
